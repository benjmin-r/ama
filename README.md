Currently [I'm](https://twitter.com/benjamin) a Ruby/Rails developer at [crispymtn](https://github.com/crispymtn), working on [Keyline](https://www.keyline-mis.de/). Before that I was CTO for [vaamo](https://www.vaamo.de) where I built the team and technology for the first four years of the company, so questions about engineering management, team building and fostering a great culture are more than welcome. All in all I have 15+ years of experience across various companies and teams.  
Outside of work I spend most of my time with my family, the wonderfullest wife in the world and [two awesome kids](https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/884450502150324224).

And: Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.
